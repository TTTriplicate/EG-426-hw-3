# EG-426 Homework 3: Kinematics

This repo contains the python scripts written by me for the third howework assignment
of EG-426 Mobile Robots at SNHU.  While I did show most of my work clearly in the 
writeup, I felt it best to have a way to show my coding work as well.

## To Run

All of the problems I felt the need to code are in their own files.  The `main.py` 
file contains a driver program.  Clone this repo and run `./main.py` or `python3 main.py` 
and it will run and output the results to the terminal.

### Requirements
This code makes use of the NumPy library.  If you do not have it installed,
you should install it with the command `python -m pip install numpy`, or 
the python package manager of your preference.
